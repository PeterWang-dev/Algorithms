# Algorithms

Algorithms in Book ***Algorithms: Forth Edition*** and exercises of [***Algrithms, Part Ⅰ***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [***Algorithms, Part Ⅱ***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2), which are written by **Java** and **C++**.

## Branches

**There are three branches of this repository.**

- main: The branch which holds [blog](https://algorithms.pwdevstudio.xyz) of learning algorithms.
- [Algorithms-by-Java](https://github.com/PeterWang-dev/Algorithms/blob/Algorithms-by-Java/): The APIs (with unit test) and Clients written in Java.
- [Algorithms-by-C++](https://github.com/PeterWang-dev/Algorithms/blob/Algorithms-by-C++/): Algorithms implications written in C++.

## Development Environment

1. **Visual Studio Code** with extension recommended and customed settings in each workspaces (vary to branches).
2. For Java, use **JDK version 8 with [alg4.jar](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/hello/hello.zip)** (in lib of hello.zip from Prinston University) to compile or run Java Programs.
3. For C++, use **minggw** for windows to compile source codes.
